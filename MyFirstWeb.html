<h1>My first webpage about Pepe !</h1>
<p>This is a sample web page about Pepe the Frog. 
    <br>
    Pepe the Frog, originally created by artist Matt Furie in 2005 as part of his comic series "Boys Club," has become an internet cultural phenomenon with a complex and sometimes controversial history. Initially intended as a laid-back and chill character, Pepe's journey took an unexpected turn as he evolved into a widely used meme across various online communities.<br>
    
    <br>Pepe's popularity skyrocketed on platforms like 4chan, Reddit, and other internet forums, where users adopted him for a plethora of humorous and often absurd contexts. The simplicity of Pepe's design and the range of emotions depicted in the original comic panels made him easily adaptable to different situations, contributing to his widespread appeal. From expressing joy and sadness to sarcasm and irony, Pepe's versatile facial expressions turned him into a meme symbolizing a myriad of emotions.<br>
    
    <br>Despite his innocent origins, Pepe became embroiled in controversy when certain iterations of the meme were associated with hate speech and extremist ideologies. Some individuals co-opted Pepe's image for racist and offensive purposes, leading to concerns about the meme's potential negative impact. This prompted Matt Furie to take legal action against those who misappropriated his creation, expressing a desire to reclaim Pepe and shift the narrative away from its darker associations.<br>
    
    <br>In response to the controversy, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) added Pepe the Frog to its database of hate symbols in 2016, acknowledging the meme's unfortunate transformation into a symbol of hate for some groups. This move sparked debates about the nature of internet memes and their potential to be hijacked for harmful purposes.<br>
    
    <br>However, the controversy didn't diminish Pepe's overall cultural significance. Many continued to use Pepe in a positive and lighthearted manner, emphasizing his original intent as a symbol of relatable and expressive emotions. The broader internet community rallied behind the idea that the meme's meaning was not inherently negative, and efforts were made to reclaim Pepe from its divisive associations.<br>
    
    <br>In essence, Pepe the Frog stands as a testament to the complex dynamics of internet culture. From its innocent beginnings to its inadvertent involvement in contentious issues, Pepe's journey reflects the evolving nature of online symbols and the challenges in controlling their interpretation. Despite the controversies, Pepe remains an enduring and influential figure in internet meme culture, embodying the unpredictable and multifaceted nature of online expression.<br></p>
